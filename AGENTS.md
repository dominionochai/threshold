# Threshold — Agent Guide

Threshold keeps one case record for a New York City household: tonight's crisis (food, bed, medical, legal) and the SNAP claim that follows. The home screen (`/home`) is the whole app: "Tell us what's going on" (free text or voice, parsed by `shared/engine/story.ts`) opens the case, then two tabs, Tonight (a map with a draggable sheet) and Claim. There is no chat surface; the helpers' voices appear in the team feed.

Actions: `get-case`, `create-case`, `rank-resources` (Scout, read-only), `request-call` (drafts a call for approval), `decide-approval` (the parent's yes or no; a yes runs the rehearsed call), `update-step`, `update-evidence`, `log-event`. Offer only places `rank-resources` returns, never invent a place, phone number, hour or street, and say when a record is unverified or its sources conflict. Nothing outbound happens without a person's yes: a call is always drafted as an approval first. Calls are rehearsed (simulated) until a real telephony provider is configured, and the UI says so. A declined bed ends honestly at 311, never with a promise. Distances are straight-line from real coordinates; directions hand off to Google Maps. Log what happens with `log-event`: the activity trail is the evidence ledger, and `linkEvidence` lines it up against the SNAP claim. Pure logic lives in `shared/engine`; data in `shared/data`. UI is mobile-first with tokens `th-*` in `app/global.css`; keep one amber action per screen and 56px tap targets.

# Framework conventions

This app started from the chat template; its chat routes and sidebar are removed from `/home`. `/` redirects to shared sign-in, then `/home`. Actions carry capabilities; screens exist only for durable workflows.

Use local docs only (no web research): `pnpm action docs-search --query "<topic>"`, `pnpm action docs-search --slug "<slug>"`, `pnpm action docs-search --list`, `pnpm action source-search --query "<pattern>"`, `pnpm action source-search --path <path>`, or `pnpm action source-search --list`. For external-agent integrations, read `pnpm action docs-search --slug "external-agents"`.

## Core rules

- UI feedback: target 100 ms, never exceed 400 ms; acknowledge before network work.
- Normal app data must flow through actions. Keep actions deterministic and focused; use agent chat/AgentSidebar for AI work and follow-ups in the same thread. Keep structured state in SQL and large files in configured storage; persist references only.
- For external integrations, inspect the workspace/provider connection catalog first; reuse its scoped resolver. Never hardcode credentials, webhook URLs, or private/customer data.
- Never fabricate. Report failures and recover; verify writes by reading the row or screen. Navigation is in `<current-screen>`; use `view-screen` for fresh visible-record details.

For custom branding, keep `server/plugins/agent-native-email-branding.ts` aligned: `app.name` appears in transactional email and optional `app.logoUrl` must be an absolute HTTPS URL.

## Application state

- `navigation` describes the view and selected ids. The case record is `home` at `/home`; `/` opens shared sign-in/signup.
- Use `navigate` when supported and `view-screen` for a fresh read of visible details; basic navigation is already in `<current-screen>`.

## Building a domain app

Choose the primary workflow and route before editing. Add a domain route under `app/routes/` and set `app.homePath` in `server/plugins/agent-native-email-branding.ts` with `defineAppConfig`. The default Get started page lives at `/home`, and Chat stays at `/chat`; edit `app/routes/home.tsx` when replacing that page with a domain-specific home. Add a static link in `app/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` before `ChatThreadsSection`; `Header.tsx` uses `APP_TITLE` elsewhere. Shared sidebar and AgentInspector remain.

Use `adding-a-feature` for functional parity and `frontend-design` for a user-facing screen. Keep feature guidance here; do not rewrite `README.md` or `DESIGN.md`. After all edits, run one typecheck, one doctor check, and one browser smoke of the primary workflow, including overlap rejection, cancellation freeing the slot, and authenticated landing. Skip production build and extra test suites.

Before building common workspace or agent UI, read `agent-native-toolkit`; for supported customization, read `customizing-agent-native`.

- Guarded verification: run `pnpm agent-native:doctor`; fix findings before done.
